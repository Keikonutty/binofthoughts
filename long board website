/* ~~ These are the columns for the layout. ~~ 

1) Padding is only placed on the top and/or bottom of the divs. The elements within these divs have padding on their sides. This saves you from any "box model math". Keep in mind, if you add any side padding or border to the div itself, it will be added to the width you define to create the *total* width. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.

2) No margin has been given to the columns since they are all floated. If you must add margin, avoid placing it on the side you're floating toward (for example: a right margin on a div set to float right). Many times, padding can be used instead. For divs where this rule must be broken, you should add a "display:inline" declaration to the div's rule to tame a bug where some versions of Internet Explorer double the margin.

3) Since classes can be used multiple times in a document (and an element can also have multiple classes applied), the columns have been assigned class names instead of IDs. For example, two sidebar divs could be stacked if necessary. These can very easily be changed to IDs if that's your preference, as long as you'll only be using them once per document.

4) If you prefer your nav on the right instead of the left, simply float these columns the opposite direction (all right instead of all left) and they'll render in reverse order. There's no need to move the divs around in the HTML source.

    <h1>How to build a longboard step by step</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Step 1</h2>
    <p>Choose the wood for your board,  we recommend birch it is very flexible and it's also very durable</p>
    <p>Types of wood: Maple wood is really heavy and sturdy, mostly used for downhill riding. Only downside to maple is that its really heavy and this can be a problem to some riders who carry their board everywhere.<br />
      Bamboo wood is very flexible and light, it is used for cruising since it easily rides over bumps and rough ground. Bamboo boards are also very good at turning.<br />
      Birch wood is very flexible like bamboo and it has sturdiness like maple wood, it is used for riding anywhere, it can handle downhill speeding and also can cruise very well.</p>
    <h2>Step 2 </h2>
    <p>Choose your bearings,  bearings are rated by ABEC the higher the ABEC rating the more precise and accurate the bearing will be. The ABEC ratings are 1,3,5,7,9  </p>
    <p>ABEC 1 bearings are the least expensive, and the worst crude, the quality of the steel is not very high<br />
      ABEC 3 bearings are generally inexpensive and do not roll smooth or quickly <br />
      ABEC 5 bearings are standard bearings for most types of skateboarding, ABEC 5 bearings provide a fast speed bearing at an affordable price.<br />
      ABEC 7 bearings are very fast and smooth, they cost slightly more than ABEC 5<br />
    ABEC 9 bearings are the fastest bearings of them all, these are the best for downhill skating and skaters who want to cruise very fast.<br />
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Step 3 </h2>
    <p>Choose your trucks, if you are wanting to speed downhill then you may want to buy Caliber trucks, they are the all around best buy<br />
      Another set of really good trucks are Paris trucks, they are high quality and are easy to adjust <br />
    If you are looking for the cheapest trucks you should buy Yoacher long board trucks, these are perfect for low cost setups if you pair them with a quality deck</p>
    <h2>Step 4 </h2>
    <p>Choose your wheels, There are different types of wheels for different environments, if you are looking to have a nice smooth ride your then sector 9 nine-balls are the best wheels for you. <br />
    If you are looking to ride your long board downhill, your best bet is to buy sector 9 race formula wheels, the fastest wheels on the market currently are Seismic speed vent wheels, they are made of durable urethane for high speed racing.</p>
    <h2>Step 5</h2>
    <p>Choosing deck for your board, you can design your own board or you can choose to buy one already designed, we recommend buying pre-designed long boards off of https://www.warehouseskateboards.com/ if you choose to do so.
