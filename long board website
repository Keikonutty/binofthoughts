    <h1>How to build a longboard step by step    </h1>
    <h2>Step 1</h2>
    <p>Choose the wood for your board,  we recommend baltic birch since it is very flexible and it's also very durable and also has the benefit of being inexpensive.</p>
    <p><img src="LBM07_Long_board_veneer_1540__50430__59410.1428497460.1280.1232.jpg" width="100" height="100" align="right" /></p>
    <p>Types of wood: Maple wood is really heavy and sturdy, mostly used for downhill riding. Only downside to maple is that its really heavy and this can be a problem to some riders who carry their board everywhere.</p>
    <p><br />
  </p>
    <p><img src="BB010_Bamboo_veneer_10pack_1540__24907__64302.1428497466.1280.1232.jpg" width="100" height="100" align="right" /></p>
    <p>Bamboo wood is very flexible and light, it is used for cruising since it easily rides over bumps and rough ground. Bamboo boards are also very good at turning.</p>
    <p><br />
    </p>
    <p><img src="FWARZLMJQMOK1DH.LARGE.jpg" width="100" height="100" align="right" /></p>
    <p>Baltic Birch wood is very flexible like bamboo and it has sturdiness like maple wood, it is used for riding anywhere, it can handle downhill speeding and also can cruise very well.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
    <h2>Step 2 </h2>
    <p>Choose your bearings,  bearings are rated by ABEC the higher the ABEC rating the more precise and accurate the bearing will be. The ABEC ratings are 1,3,5,7,9  </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><img src="61N61YqYM2L._SL1336_.jpg" width="100" height="100" align="right" /></p>
    <p>ABEC 1 bearings are the least expensive, and the worst crude, the quality of the steel is not very high</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><br />
      <img src="81L7b5cYQ1L._SX425_.jpg" width="100" height="100" align="right" /></p>
    <p>ABEC 3 bearings are generally inexpensive and do not roll smooth or quickly</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p> <br />
      <img src="download.jfif" width="100" height="100" align="right" /></p>
    <p>ABEC 5 bearings are standard bearings for most types of skateboarding, ABEC 5 bearings provide a fast speed bearing at an affordable price.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><img src="atom-abec7-2.jpg" width="100" height="100" align="right" /><br />
      ABEC 7 bearings are very fast and smooth, they cost slightly more than ABEC 5<br />
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><img src="524549_524549_1.jfif" width="100" height="100" align="right" /></p>
    <p>ABEC 9 bearings are the fastest bearings of them all, these are the best for downhill skating and skaters who want to cruise very fast.</p>
    <p><br />
    </p>
    <h2>Step 3 </h2>
    <p><img src="hd_product_Caliber-II-Grey-50_Deg-(Set-HD).png" width="100" height="100" align="right" />Choose your trucks, if you are wanting to speed downhill then you may want to buy Caliber trucks, they are the all around best buy.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><img src="hd_product_Paris_V2_Raw__Pair_.png" width="100" height="100" align="right" /><br />
    Another set of really good trucks are Paris trucks, they are high quality and are easy to adjust.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><img src="6183jtYBzWL._SX466_.jpg" width="100" height="100" align="right" /><br />
      If you are looking for the cheapest trucks you should buy Yoacher long board trucks, these are perfect for low cost setups if you pair them with a quality deck.</p>
    <h2>Step 4 </h2>
    <p><img src="ezgif-2-9f03c2c0ccaf.jpg" width="450" height="168" align="right" /></p>
    <p>Wheels are the deciding factor on whether you want to slide or want a grippy setup. They also decide how fast you go or how slow you go.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Step 5</h2>
    <h1 align="right">&nbsp;</h1>
<p><img src="cruiser-boards-diagram1-1.jpg" width="304" height="207" align="right" />Choosing deck for your board, you can design your own board or you can choose to buy one already designed, we recommend buying pre-designed long boards off of https://www.warehouseskateboards.com/ if you choose to do so.
